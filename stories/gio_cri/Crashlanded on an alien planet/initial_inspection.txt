you inspect the pod starting from the food and water compartment. pods are designed for 5 people so there should be plenty of food there.
when you open the hatch however you are meet by something you would't have expected. there is a little fox hidden in there he is shaking scared by all the loud noises and violent movement of the landing.
he seems so defensless and scared that you feel the need to confort him. you take him out of the pod and he seems really calm when you hold it, too calm for a wild animal.
you are thinking abot how this fox could have ended here, maybe it was someone pet and they took him onboard despite it being forbitten?maybe he...... your train of thoughts is interrupted by the cute fox licking your face.
it doesn't really matter where this fox comes from he is now your companion and you will have to take care of each other.
